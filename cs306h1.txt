1. Advantages: FOSS Software, greater scientific and programming capabilities. 
Disadvantages: Less access to some proprietary software, occassional driver difficulty for device compatability

2. Drives are mounted as parts of the greater root system.

3. While it could be either a directory named "testdir" or a file named "testdir" that has no filename expansion, technically directories are also files in Linux

10. To move a file to a new location and to rename a file

11. To create a new empty file and to update the date of last modification on a file

12. Pipeliness can run in parallel and execute sections of command simultaneously

13. ls -la | wc -l

14. Effective user and groups IDs are changable IDs that can be given to users and groups to access certain things they normally wouldn't have the privilege to do

15. a-a-testx1.txt ; b-x-tst22.wav ; c-@-test%1.css ; a-<-test!3.aac ; b-7-tst^4.ogg

16. chmod 675 test.txt

17. chmod u+x test.txt

18. The program did not finish successfully, some error occurred.
